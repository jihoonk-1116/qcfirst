## CSS Deliverable

#### Differences between wireframes and deliverable

Kim: When I drew the wireframes for this project, I felt that designing of website is not harder than my expectation because wireframing can be depicted as I thinking. When I writing HTML code, also, I felt that designing is not hard. The CSS deliverable, but, is totally different level. I spent a half-day aligning the index page's layout. After I decided that my CSS ability is not enough to implement, I used the Bootstrap framework. It is really powerful in terms of aligning content, designing the layout, and even responsiveness. Because of it, I can complete the CSS deliverable following my wireframes.  The biggest difference between the two is that designing a web page is impossible without understanding CSS, HTML, and several features such as display, box model, grid layout, selector, etc. Also,  implementation of responsiveness can be done with several techniques such as shrink font size, margin and padding, modifying the layout, and its design.
